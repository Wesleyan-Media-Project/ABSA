Of all the actions $T$ has taken as President, many of us have found nothing more horrific than his policy of separating migrant children from their parents at our border. This policy has once again come into sharper focus with recent reports that our government cannot locate the parents of more than 500 separated migrant children and reunite them with their families. This should come as no surprise to anyone. NBC News disclosed a Justice Department memo written in 2017 after federal prosecutors conducted a family separation “pilot” program and determined that children 12 and younger should not be separated because most would not be capable of finding their way back to their parents on their own. In July of 2019, I introduced a resolution calling for the Pennsylvania House to condemn the Trump administration's cruel treatment of migrant families... The Republican majority did not even allow debate on my resolution. By remaining silent and not stepping up to question the President’s family separation policies, the House majority's leaders and members were complicit in in the separation of children from their parents. I absolutely do not believe Republican voters in my district support the separation of children from their families further demonstrating how the right-wing majority that controls Harrisburg is out of step with local Republicans and nearly everyone else in our communities. There are critics who say I should “stay in my lane”, the treatment of migrant children is a federal issue. I say to them, as a mother and as an elected official who represents thousands of people who truly care about this issue, this is my lane. The insensitivity and lack of leadership on this issue displayed by the Republican majority in Harrisburg is further evidence as to why we need to flip the Pennsylvania House form red to blue. Some would say this is simply partisan rhetoric but I say it is more. Character is not only on the ballot in the Presidential election.

Voter suppression tactics are nothing new for the right wing but in this election their conniving has taken on an air of desperation as Harrisburg Republicans answer the clarion call of Donald Trump to undermine mail-in-voting and voters' confidence in the outcome of the election. Their goal is to create chaos, setting the stage for legal challenges to election results that growing evidence suggests will not be in their favor. Their full-frontal embrace of voter suppression tactics includes: Attempting to shorten the time period in which voters may request a mail-in ballot Trying to eliminate satellite ballot drop-boxes Appealing to the United States Supreme Court to reverse a ruling made by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court requiring election authorities to accept mail-in ballots received up to three days after November 3, as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day (a ruling made necessary because of Republican attempts to impede the Post Office’s ability to process mail-in ballots in a timely manner) Refusing to allow election authorities to begin counting ballots before Election Day Eliminating the requirement that poll watchers must be from the county where they seek to serve as a credentialed election observer And, to make matters worse, $T$ is hell-bent on stacking the Supreme Court in his favor in the event the high court has to serve as the final arbitrator in any election disputes. Be assured that the Governor, legislative leaders and Democratic Party officials are anticipating and preparing for an array of legal challenges and electoral eventualities. Unfortunately, I do not believe we have a level playing field. We would all like to have confidence in our system of justice and electoral process but early indications raise legitimate concerns as to what extremes our opponents will go. There is one sure-fired way to counter the chaos the Republicans are seeking to create. We must win this election decisively and we must flip the Pennsylvania House from red to blue. We need a victory that does not leave one scintilla of doubt as to the outcome. We must make this election challenge-proof and have a new majority in the legislature to prevent any further electoral shenanigans. To that end, if you applied to vote by mail, follow the voting instructions (don’t forget the secrecy envelope) and mail your ballot as soon as you get it or take it to a designated drop box location. If you are not voting by mail, consider voting early in person at the Chester County Voter Services office from now through Election Day or at one of two satellite offices beginning October 5, 2020. If you plan to vote at your polling place in person on Election Day, please bring a friend or family member, vote early and stay safe. Vote! Vote! Vote! The democracy you save may be yours.",P80001571,1897,1909,ad_creative_body,Donald Trump,-1,"In my district to date, 11,300 or 61% of Democratic voters have applied to vote by mail compared to 4,600 or 25% of Republicans. The surge of enthusiasm we are seeing in Democratic voters in Pennsylvania is scaring the bejesus out of Republicans in Harrisburg. Their fear of a blue wave has caused them to embrace every trick they can find in the voter suppression handbook, including plotting to ignore the will of voters and using an archaic loophole in the United States Constitution that potentially could allow them to seat their own set of pro-Trump Electoral College electors in defiance of election results.

He has repeatedly taken over YouTube's entire homepage. The campaign claims to have half a billion video views over the last four months alone. During a socially distanced campaign season where people are staying home and streaming more than ever, YouTube could play an even more influential role than Facebook. “Politico” has called YouTube Trump’s “secret weapon,” a below-the-radar advantage that didn't become apparent until it was too late. MoveOn is working hard to counter Trump's dominant position on YouTube. We’re creating tons of videos and then using advanced analytics to precision-target high potential voters in 17 battleground states. But we need your help to ensure we have the resources to pull it off and power our plan all the way through Election Day.
