This is what we’ve been preparing for; this is why millions of feminists marched on January 21, 2017. We must rise to the urgency of this moment. We have to show up and march for all women – for trans, Black, Indigenous, and Brown women, and for future generations. In the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s passing, thousands of Women’s Marchers gathered across the country in their communities to honor the life and legacy of the notorious RBG. Together, we showed the world that this movement is more committed and fired up than ever to carry on the fight for justice and equality that RBG led for so long.

Mitch McConnell STOLE a Supreme Court seat from President Obama, and now he’s reversing his own rule to force a right-wing nominee through for Donald Trump just before Election Day. Flipping the Senate is our LAST line of defense against this hypocritical and dangerous attack on our democracy. ⏳ EMERGENCY TRIPLE-MATCH EXPIRES AT 11:59 P.M. ⏳ We CAN flip the Senate and end Mitch McConnell’s right-wing takeover of our Supreme Court once and for all. We only need to flip FOUR seats to do it, and experts show us leading in at least SIX battleground states. But a McConnell-aligned super PAC has booked an unprecedented $111 MILLION worth of attack ads against us, so we need your immediate support to fight back. PLEASE -- RUSH $25 (IT WILL BECOME $100!) TO END ","’S DISGRACEFUL MAJORITY, PROTECT THE SUPREME COURT, AND FLIP THE SENATE! ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED UNTIL 11:59 P.M."
