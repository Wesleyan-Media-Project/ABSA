I heard their story first hand and it broke my heart. I was impressed with Robert and his resilience and wisdom. Sue is a strong, kind, and wonderful woman who told me many stories she had with customers over the years. Sue is also a generous person and once helped a customer afford a nicer quality mattress than he initially purchased. Wisconsin is our home, and Sue, Keith, and Robert are part of our family. It’s time we begin to take care of one another and put an end to hate and violence. Remember, we all have to live somewhere so let’s work towards peace and prosperity and build a strong community that all can enjoy.
